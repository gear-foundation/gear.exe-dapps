# Arkanoid Simulation Benchmark

This document describes the setup, execution, and benchmark results of the **Arkanoid Simulation** across different platforms: Ethereum, Arbitrum EVM, Arbitrum Nitro, and Gear.exe. The simulation tests high-load computations to measure cost, speed, and scalability on each network.

## Cost and Gas Comparison

## Benchmark Overview and Advantages

1. **Ethereum**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides a baseline for comparison. Running high-load simulations like Arkanoid on Ethereum highlights the expense and limitations due to high gas fees.

2. **Arbitrum EVM**:
   - **Setup**: The simulation ran on Arbitrum’s standard EVM with similar gas consumption to Ethereum. However, transaction costs are lower due to reduced gas prices.

3. **Arbitrum Nitro**:
   - **Setup**: Allows larger transaction capacity with up to 1,000 iterations per block. Provides a cost-efficient solution compared to Ethereum but still involves multiple transactions for high-load processes.

4. **Gear.exe**:
   - **Key Advantage**: Gear.exe allowed us to run **16 simultaneous Arkanoid simulations**, all of which fit within a single block. Each simulation involved high-load calculations, and Gear.exe’s architecture enabled these processes to complete without interruptions or additional messages.

## Conclusion

This comparison illustrates that Gear.exe offers unparalleled efficiency by fitting multiple high-load simulations into a single block at minimal cost.
